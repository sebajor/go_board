@W: MT529 :"c:\users\seba\documents\go_board\vga_test\vga_controller.v":87:1:87:6|Found inferred clock vga_controller|i_Clk which controls 20 sequential elements including v_counter[9:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
