@W: MT462 :"c:\users\seba\documents\go_board\uart\uart_rx.v":72:0:72:5|Net uart_rx.r_valid appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. If this is a required clock, declare a clock constraint on this net in your constraint file.
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\seba\documents\go_board\uart\uart_rx.v":98:0:98:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including uart_rx.out_data[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\seba\documents\go_board\uart\uart_rx.v":29:8:29:13|Found inferred clock top|i_Clk which controls 43 sequential elements including uart_rx.state[6:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
